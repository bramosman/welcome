This code includes a header element with a search form that allows users to input a search query and submit it to the server. The main element is empty and will be populated with search results once the user submits a search query. The footer element includes a copyright notice.
Note that this is just a basic template, and you will need to write server-side code to handle the search query and return search results to the client.
